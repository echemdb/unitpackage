echemdb Change Log
==================

.. current developments

v0.11.1
====================

**Removed:**

* Removed dependency clevercsv and used Python's csv instead.



v0.11.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added modules from `echemdb-converters` (https://github.com/echemdb/echemdb-converters v4.0.1) as modules in unitpackage within `unitpackage.loaders`.
* Added support for Python 3.14.
* Added dependency `click>=8,<9`
* Added dependency `clevercsv>=0.7.0,<0.9.0`

**Removed:**

* Removed support for Python 3.9.
* Removed dependency on iteration_utilities.



v0.10.1
====================

**Added:**

* Added property `identifiers` to `Collection`, returning a list of identifiers of the collection.
* Added additional methods to `collection.__getitem__()`, allowing for creating new collections from existing collections by providing a list of identifiers (`db["id1","id2"]`), integers (`db[0,2]`) or simply a slice (`db[2:3]`). Additionally, entries can now be selected by their position in the collection (`entry = db[3]`).

**Changed:**

* Changed `collection.bibliography` to a cached_property.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed showing plotly plots in the documentation, by using plotly 5 in the workflow to build the documentation.



v0.10.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `unitpackage.database.echemdb_entry.CVEntry` and `unitpackage.database.echemdb.EchemdbEntry`, with specific functionalities for the echemdb data repository.
* Added tests for Python 3.13.

**Changed:**

* Changed metadata example keys to use camelCase for consistency with JSON naming conventions.
* Use electrochemistry-data release 0.5.0 for remote data tests.
* Changed upper version bound for plotly from "<6" to "<7".
* Changed version bound for pybtex from ">=0.24,<0.25" to ">=0.25,<0.26".

**Deprecated:**

* Deprecated `unitpackage.cv.cv_entry.CVEntry` and `unitpackage.cv.cv_collection.CVCollection`.

**Removed:**

* Removed unused dependency `filelock`.



v0.9.2
====================

**Changed:**

* Changed upper version bound for astropy from <=7 to <8.



v0.9.1
====================

**Removed:**

* Removed `unitpackage.local.collect_datapackage` since it is identical to frictionless `package = Package()`.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed creating and saving entries containing upper case characters, which are converted to lowercase, to match the frictionless specifications.



v0.9.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `entry.add_column` which allows adding a column to an existing pandas dataframe and extends the Data Package fields with given units.
* Added the property `entry.mutable_resource`, which is a virtual modifiable copy of the original resource excluding its metadata.
* Added `unitpackage.local.collect_resources`, which collects all resources from a list of frictionless Data Packages.
* Added `collection.from_local_file` to create a collection from the resources included in a Data Package (JSON).
* Added validation to check for duplicate resource names upon creating a collection.
* Added wheel upload on new release.
* Added dependency `iteration_utilities`.

**Changed:**

* Changed `unitpackage.entry.Entry` from being a frictionless Data Package into a frictionless Resource.
* Changed `unitpackage.collection.Collection` from being a collection of frictionless Data Packages  into a collection of frictionless Resources forming a Data Package.
* Changed the virtual `echemdb` Resource into an `entry.mutable_resource`.
* Changed `unitpackage.local.create_df_resource` to create a resource from an actual frictionless Resource instead of a frictionless Data Package.
* Changed packages for development to be provided by pixi instead of conda directly.

**Removed:**

* Removed argument `resource_name` in `unitpackage.local.create_df_resource` and all other instances where resources were named "echemdb".

**Fixed:**

* Fixed parsing of arguments `data` and `outdir` for `collection.from_remote` downloading data from the default remote url.
* Fixed breaking tests on GitHub (tests should be more stable now since we switched to pixi for locked versions of dependencies.)

**Performance:**

* Improved loading collections via `collection.from_local` or `collection.from_remote` and entries via `entry.from_local`. In contrast to the previous version, dataframes are now only loaded when a method or property is called that requires access to the resource's data. This also increases the speed for filtering the data based on metadata predicates.



v0.8.5
====================

**Added:**

* Added `Entry.rename_fields`, returning an entry new with field names and dataframe column names.
* Added the classmethod `Entry._modify_fields` that updates a list of fields, and allows keeping the original name.



v0.8.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed `entry.save`, where the saved datapackages contained the `echemdb` resource.



v0.8.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed saving entries with `date` and `datetime` objects.



v0.8.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed creation of fields, when not all fields were provided to `local.create_unitpackage`.
* Fixed creating an entry from the parent directory with `Entry.from_csv`.



v0.8.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed binder configuration files and links.
* Upgraded to pandas version 2.



v0.8.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `entry.save` which creates a unitpackage, i.e., a CSV file and a JSON file, in the directory `outdir`.
* Added `collection.save_entries` saves the entries of this collection using `entry.save`.
* Added `Collection.from_local`, creating a collection from local datapackages.
* Added `Collection.from_remote`, creating a collection from remote datapackages collected from a url containing a ZIP.
* Added `Entry.from_local`, loading an entry from a local datapackage.
* Added `Entry.from_csv`, creating an entry from a CSV and optionally allows adding metadata to the entry and modifying the field properties.
* Added `Entry.from_df`, creating an entry from a pandas dataframe and optionally allows adding metadata to the entry and modifying the field properties.

**Changed:**

* Changed default url to collect datapackages to assets in https://github.com/echemdb/electrochemistry-data/releases.
* Changed loading echemdb data, using `Collection.from_remote()` instead of `Collection()`.
* Changed `Entry.create_examples` to load pre-defined datapackages instead of generating datapackges from SVGs with the `svgdigitizer`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `svgdigitizer` as dependency used in automated tests.
* Removed `Entry._digitize_example`, used to create datapackages for automated test.
*

**Fixed:**

* Fixed the description of the project in the `setup.py`.



v0.7.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed content of the Changelog to indicate that `unitpackage` originates from https://github.com/echemdb/echemdb.



v0.7.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed `entry.rescale` which returned an erroneous entry.
