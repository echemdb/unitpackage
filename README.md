This module provides a Python library to interact with a collection of
[frictionless datapackages](https://frictionlessdata.io/). Such datapackages consist of a CSV (data) file which is annotated with a JSON file.
This allows storing additional information such as units used in the columns of a CSV or store metadata describing the underlying data.
Example datapackages can be found [here](https://github.com/echemdb/unitpackage/tree/main/doc/files/) and a JSON could be structured as follows

```json
{
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "demo_package",
            "type": "table",
            "path": "demo_package.csv",
            "scheme": "file",
            "format": "csv",
            "mediatype": "text/csv",
            "encoding": "utf-8",
            "schema": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "t",
                        "type": "number",
                        "unit": "s"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "j",
                        "type": "number",
                        "unit": "A / m2"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "metadata": {
                "echemdb": {
                    "description": "Sample data for the unitpackage module.",
                    "curation": {
                        "process": [
                            {
                                "role": "experimentalist",
                                "name": "John Doe",
                                "laboratory": "Institute of Good Scientific Practice",
                                "date": "2021-07-09"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The metadata of an entries' resource in a collection is accessible from the python API.

```python
>>> from unitpackage.collection import Collection
>>> db = Collection.from_local('./doc/files')
>>> entry = db['demo_package_cv']
>>> entry.description
'Sample data for the unitpackage module.'
```

From the API also a simple 2D plot can be drawn.

```python
>>> entry.plot()
```

Ultimately, the `unitpackage` allows for simple transformation of data within a resource into different units.

```python
>>> entry.get_unit('j')
'A / m2'
>>> entry.df
          t         E        j
0  0.000000	-0.196962 0.043009
1  0.011368	-0.196393 0.051408
...
>>> entry.rescale({'E' : 'mV', 'j' : 'uA / m2'}).df
          t           E             j
0  0.000000 -196.961730  43008.842162
1  0.011368 -196.393321  51408.199892
...
```

Collections for specific measurement types can be created, which provide additional accessibility to the meatadata or simplify the representation of such data in common plot types. An example of such a collection can be found on [echemdb.org](https://www.echemdb.org/cv), which shows Cyclic Voltammetry data annotated following [echemdb's metadata schema](https://github.com/echemdb/metadata-schema), which can be stored in a `CVCollection` and is retrieved from the [echemdb data repository](https://github.com/echemdb/electrochemistry-data).

Detailed installation instructions, description of the modules, advanced usage examples, including
local collection creation, are provided in our
[documentation](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/).
